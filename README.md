# Qubit Simulator
A very priomitive Qubit simulator that supports 4 Gates: Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Hadamard, along with Measurment for one Qubit.

Supports a curcuit-like implementation upon instantiating the qubit:
Qubit q(0);

q.H()->Z()->H()->M(); //|0> goes to |1>

TBD whether more will be added or revised.
